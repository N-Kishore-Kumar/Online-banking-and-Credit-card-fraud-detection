In this project, we showed the working model of bank system and its many functionalities. The aim is creating a Bank Management System. This helps the bank employees to make all the transitions very fast instead of recording it manually. We have used PHP as back-end, HTML as front-end, CSS and Bootstrap for styling and MySQL as database connection. We have also made a credit card fraud detection in our bank system. We used SOM algorithm and ANN algorithm to check if the credit card is fraud or not.
